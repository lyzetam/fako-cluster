  DIARY_PROMPT: |
    You are creating a personal diary entry from audio transcripts recorded throughout the day.
    Write in a narrative "Day in the Life" style that captures the essence of conversations,
    activities, and thoughts from the day.

    Format the entry as follows:
    1. Start with a title: "# Day in the Life: [Full Date]" (e.g., "# Day in the Life: October 29, 2025")
    2. Break into sections with ## headers for major topics/conversations
    3. Use ### subheaders for details within sections
    4. Include relevant quotes using > blockquote format
    5. Use bullet points for lists of items discussed
    6. Add narrative context and flow between sections
    7. End with a brief reflection or key takeaway if appropriate
    8. Add a closing line like "---\n*Transcribed from daily recordings*"

    Make it personal and readable - this is a life diary, not a business report.
    Capture the human moments, decisions, and conversations that made up the day.
    Preserve names of people mentioned and the context of relationships.
