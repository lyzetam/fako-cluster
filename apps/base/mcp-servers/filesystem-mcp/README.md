# Filesystem MCP Server

This deployment runs the official Model Context Protocol (MCP) filesystem server in Kubernetes using the official Docker image.

## Overview

The filesystem MCP server provides secure filesystem operations including:
- Read/write files
- Create/list/delete directories  
- Move files/directories
- Search files
- Get file metadata

## Architecture

This deployment uses the **official MCP filesystem Docker image** (`mcp/filesystem`):

- Runs the authentic MCP filesystem server as a persistent process
- Has access to persistent volumes: `/data`, `/logs`, `/config`
- Proper stdio transport as designed by the MCP specification
- Security-hardened with non-root user and dropped capabilities

### Current Status:
- **Phase 1**: Running the official MCP server container âœ…
- **Phase 2**: HTTP bridge for remote access (planned)

## Usage

The server automatically starts with access to three directories mounted from PVCs:
- `/data` - Main data storage (filesystem-mcp-data PVC)
- `/logs` - Log storage (filesystem-mcp-logs PVC) 
- `/config` - Configuration storage (filesystem-mcp-config PVC)

**Note**: Currently running in Phase 1 - the MCP server container only. HTTP bridge for remote access will be added in Phase 2.

## Volumes

The server has access to three persistent volumes:
- `/data` - Main data storage (filesystem-mcp-data PVC)
- `/logs` - Log storage (filesystem-mcp-logs PVC)
- `/config` - Configuration storage (filesystem-mcp-config PVC)

## Security

- Runs as non-root user (UID 1000)
- All filesystem operations are restricted to the allowed directories
- Capabilities dropped for enhanced security

## Troubleshooting

### Check Pod Status
```bash
kubectl get pods -n mcp-servers -l app.kubernetes.io/name=filesystem-mcp-server
```

### View Logs
```bash
kubectl logs -n mcp-servers deployment/filesystem-mcp-server
```

### Test Server Process
```bash
# Check if the MCP server process is running
kubectl exec -n mcp-servers deployment/filesystem-mcp-server -- \
  ps aux | grep 'node.*index.js'
```

## Architecture Details

**Phase 1** - MCP Server Container:
1. **Uses official MCP filesystem Docker image** (`mcp/filesystem`)
2. **Runs persistent MCP server process** with access to `/data`, `/logs`, `/config`
3. **Process monitoring** to keep container alive and healthy
4. **Proper security context** with non-root user and dropped capabilities

## Notes

- The server requires at least one allowed directory to operate
- Currently runs the MCP server process in a monitoring loop to keep the container alive
- Phase 2 will add HTTP bridge for remote access
